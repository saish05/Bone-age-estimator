# Bone-age-estimator
This project estimates bone age from hand X-ray images using the Xception model. It preprocesses images with techniques like LOG, Gaussian Gradient, Sobel, and Canny Edge Detection. The RSNA Bone Age dataset is used to train the model, achieving accurate predictions to aid in diagnosing growth disorders.
